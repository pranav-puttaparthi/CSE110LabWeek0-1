# About Me
### As a programmer:
My name is Pranav Puttaparthi. I started programming when I was a child, due to a growing interest in helping the world around me through coding. I taught myself a lot of programming languages around that time, from **HTML** and **CSS** to **Java** and **C++**, and pored through sites like [Youtube](https://youtube.com) to help myself learn them all. I remember really being fascinated by printing empty lines in Java (`System.out.println("");`) and I don't even know why.

I've worked (and am currently working) on several software projects of my own. One project I made in high school was a game in Java where a green circle collects yellow circles while avoiding green circles. One project I'm working on is an even bigger game project about a dude who has to try to find a way to escape his crazy ex-girlfriend's house (this one is currently being made using the engine LÃ–VE 2D).

Languages I should improve on:
- [x] Python
- [x] JavaScript
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C#
